# Heart Disease Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to predict whether a person has heart disease based on multiple health features. Using a dataset containing various medical attributes, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying heart disease risk early.

## Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can save lives by enabling timely intervention. This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## Features Used

The model considers several features, including but not limited to:

- Age
- Gender
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved

## Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaadZaidi1/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction# heart-disease-prediction
